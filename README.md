# Social_Network_Analysis
Social Network Analysis is a set of methods used to  visualize networks, describe specific characteristics of  overall network structure, and build mathematical and   statistical models of network structures and dynamics.   In this project we will be using a small network that  indicates interactions in the famous Sanskrit epic  Ramayana.
